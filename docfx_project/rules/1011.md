**Description** : Enums with Flag Attribute should have its values as the power of 2

The FlagsAttribute enables members of an Enumeration to be meaningful combined or in other words be treated as a set of flags. For successful and meaningful combining of the enum members, the values of each member should be set such that a bitwise operation can be performed on the numeric value. Defining enumeration with powers of two ensures that the combined enumeration constants do not overlap.

**Non-Complaint Code**

```
[Flags]
public enum Days
{
  Monday = 1,
  Tuesday,
  Wednesday,
  Thursday,
  Friday,
  Saturday,
  Sunday
}
```
