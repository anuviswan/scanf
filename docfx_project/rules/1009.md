**Code Fix Available**: No

**Description** : Constructor should not invoke any virtual methods

When an object is constructed, the constructors is run from in the order from base class to the most derieved class, while the initializer would run the reverse order - from the most derieved type to the base class.

However, since the object being initialized is of the type derieved class, the virtual method would be always run on the derieved type. This could lead to a situation where the virtual method might be run on a type, whose constructor is yet to be executed and thereby, leave the instance in undesired state.

**Non-Complaint Code**

```
public class Base
{
	protected int InternalValue;
	public Base()
	{
		InternalValue = -10;
		Foo();
	}

	public virtual void Foo()
	{
		InternalValue++;
	}

	public void Print()
	{
		Console.WriteLine(InternalValue);
	}
}

public class Child:Base
{
	public Child()
	{
		InternalValue = 10;
	}

	public override void Foo()
	{
		InternalValue+=2;
	}
}
```
