ðŸ”–Code Smell

**Category** : Code Smell

**Rule Id** : SF1010

**Code Fix Available**: Yes

**Description** : Custom Exceptions should be always public

Non-public exception would conceal the exception from clients, forcing them to use generic or closest exception. This would defeat the purpose of having custom exception and custom information associated with it.

**Non-Complaint Code**

```
internal class CustomException:Exception
{
}
```

**Code Fix**

Exception should be public

```
public class CustomException:Exception
{
}
```
