ðŸ”–async, naming-conventions

**Category** : Naming Conventions

**Rule Id** : SF1008

**Code Fix Available**: Yes

**Description** : Async method should be named with a suffix `Async`.

Async method should be named with a suffix `Async` whenever possible. The `Async` suffix convention would communicate to the client that the method is awaitable.

**Non-Complaint Code**

```
public Task GetData()
{
}
```

**Code Fix**

Code Fix with method named.

```
public Task GetDataAsync()
{
}
```
