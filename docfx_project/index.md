# SCANF - Static Code Analyzer aNd code Fixes

Scanf is a static code analyzer and code fixes solution build particularly for C# developers.

## What is a Static Code analyzer

Static Code Analysis allows you to inspect and examine code before execution (during design time) for possible violation of quality, naming convention/style and other issues.

If a violation is found by the analyzer, it would be reported in Error List Window as well as marked with a squiggle in the Editor. The Code analyzer could include one or more suggestive code fixes for the issue reported, which the developer could apply to correct the violation.
